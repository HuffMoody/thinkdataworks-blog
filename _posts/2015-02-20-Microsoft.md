Today, [ThinkData Works](http://www.thinkdataworks.com) has launched
their Namara.io platform at the Microsoft Store in Yorkdale Mall. Microsoft is
dedicated to the open data movement and has partnered with ThinkData, providing
them access to their cloud platform, Azure, through the BizSpark Plus program.
Through this relationship, Microsoft is helping ThinkData provide developers with
access to a catalogue of up to date and relevant public data, fostering the development
of data driven apps and services.

Through the development of the
[Namara.io](http://www.Namara.io) platform, ThinkData has aggregated available
open data released by all levels of government across Canada into a single
portal. Namara.io organizes and catalogues this public data, providing users
with API access to high value information. 

“We’re really pleased to be announcing our
platform release at Microsoft because they have been so supportive to our
startup and the open data movement in general” says Bryan Smith, Co-founder and
CEO of ThinkData Works. “Azure is an amazing platform; giving startups like
ours access to it through the BizSpark Plus program has enabled us to build a
really powerful tool.“  

Helping a startup like ThinkData is all
part of Microsoft’s efforts to support the open tech movement says Keith Loo of
Microsoft Canada. “Microsoft prides itself on embracing everything that is
open; Open Standards, Open Source and open data.  We were excited to support companies like
ThinkData because we believe that together we can help make the world a more
open place, leading to better solutions and apps for our fellow citizens.”
