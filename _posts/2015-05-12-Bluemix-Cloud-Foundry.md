## IBM Announces integration with Namara.io

IBM announced a bunch of new Bluemix services to help developers create analytics-driven cloud apps.

IBM has announced several new services, including a .NET Runtime, on its Bluemix Platform as a Service (PaaS). Announced at the Cloud Foundry Summit in Santa Clara, Calif., the new services will make it easier for developers to create cloud applications for mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain analytics and intelligent infrastructure solutions. They will be added to the more than 100 services already available in the Bluemix catalog, which also includes complementary analytics tools from IBM such as those found in the recently unveiled IoT Zone and Watson Zone.

IBM is adding more of its own technology into Bluemix, including Bluemix API Management, which enables developers to rapidly create, deploy, and share large scale APIs, and provides a simple and consumable way of controlling critical APIs. IBM also is adding new mobile capabilities available on Bluemix for the IBM MobileFirst Platform, which enables development of  location-based mobile apps that connect insights from digital engagement and physical presence.
 IBM announced several new ecosystem and third-party services being added to Bluemix. These include .NET Runtime in IBM Bluemix and open sourcing of .NET Buildpack which gives s developers in any Cloud Foundry- based environment the ability to leverage Microsoft's development capabilities, making it easier to integrate multiple cloud workloads.
 
Other moves include the addition of the Namara.io platform by ThinkData Works, which aggregates and catalogues available open data into a single portal, providing businesses, developers, and citizens with API access to high- value information.
