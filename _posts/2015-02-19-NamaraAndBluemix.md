**The quickest, most efficient way to build open data apps**

Citizens, developers, and enthusiasts will
stay busy this weekend hacking away on open data in honour of Open Data Day, an
international event calling on all citizens to write applications, create
visualizations, and publish analyses using open public data. 

As the weekend gears up, it’s important to
have great resources at your fingertips that make it simple to work with open
data and build apps that have the ability to truly change the world. Two tools
that can help maximize your time coding this weekend are ThinkData’s Namara.io
platform and IBM’s Bluemix. 

In short, ThinkData’s Namara.io platform
[Namara.io](http://www.Namara.io) aggregates available open
data released by all levels of government across Canada. Namara.io organizes
and catalogues this public data, providing users with API access to high value
information. 
  
[IBM’s Bluemix ](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/bluemix/)
is a cloud platform that helps developers rapidly build, manage, and run web and
mobile applications. Bluemix not only offers developers a broad range of IBM,
third-party, and open source APIs and services, but also integrates with many
of the developer tools already in use today. 

The great thing about these two products is
that they share a very similar vision. By abstracting lower-level
infrastructure components, Bluemix enables developers to spend more time
writing the code that will differentiate their app and drive user adoption and
engagement. Namara accomplishes that same goal with respect to open data. It’s
about making it as easy as possible to integrate data into an app so developers
can focus on polishing their end product. 

Together, these two products create a very
powerful environment where developers can work with high value data in an
extremely digestible format, while at the same time accessing all the tools and
infrastructure they need to bring their ideas to life. 

Open Data is the 21st century’s new natural resource fuelling the budding Innovation Economy. As the Industrial
Economy was fuelled with oil, the Innovation Economy will be fuelled by data.
And like oil, data will be mined and processed for value – it’s unique value
being insights previously unimaginable. 

Let’s work together this weekend to showcase
the potential of what open data is about to become.

**ABOUT THINKDATA**

ThinkData
is a Toronto-based open data startup that aggregates information from all
levels of government, allowing developers, businesses, and citizens to access
high value data in standard useable formats. They work with businesses of all
sizes, from blue chip organizations providing services to millions of people to
small startups trying to disrupt a specific sector, by identifying relevant
open data and building constant access into their product or service. To date,
ThinkData has amassed a catalogue containing all available open data in Canada,
and is working to capture all of North America. 

**ABOUT IBM BLUEMIX**

IBM® Bluemix™ is the IBM open cloud platform that
provides mobile and web developers access to IBM software for integration,
security, transaction, and other key functions, as well as software from
business partners.

Built on the [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org/) open source technology, Bluemix offers more control to application
developers by using its Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering, and also
provides pre-built Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) capabilities. The goal
is to simplify the delivery of an application by providing services that are
ready for immediate use and hosting capabilities to enable internal scale
development. With the broad set of services and runtimes in Bluemix, the
developer gains control and flexibility, and has access to various data options,
from predictive analytics to big data.
