Toronto's open data initiative has made life better in this city for anyone who's relies on a bus or streetcar to get to work. But in addition the helpful TTC apps out there, developers have also capitalized on the available information to improve our access to city run services across the board. The latest example is Rink Time, a straightforward app that makes finding outdoor skating and shinny times around Toronto a cinch.

Created by ThinkData Works during a hackathon last month, Rink Time is the definition of an easy to navigate use-specific app. Try it out next time you're looking to go for a skate or play some shinny.

Checkout the app at [Rinkti.me](http://rinkti.me/#/)!
