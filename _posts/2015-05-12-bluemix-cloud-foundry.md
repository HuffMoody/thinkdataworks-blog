IBM announced a bunch of new Bluemix services to help developers create analytics-driven cloud apps. IBM has announced several new services, including a .NET Runtime, on its Bluemix Platform as a Service (PaaS). 

Announced at the Cloud Foundry Summit in Santa Clara, Calif., the new services will make it easier for developers to create cloud applications for mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain analytics and intelligent infrastructure solutions. They will be added to the more than 100 services already available in the Bluemix catalog, which also includes complementary analytics tools from IBM such as those found in the recently unveiled IoT Zone and Watson Zone.

IBM is adding more of its own technology into Bluemix, including Bluemix API Management, which enables developers to rapidly create, deploy, and share large scale APIs, and provides a simple and consumable way of controlling critical APIs. IBM also is adding new mobile capabilities available on Bluemix for the IBM MobileFirst Platform, which enables development of  location-based mobile apps that connect insights from digital engagement and physical presence.

IBM announced several new ecosystem and third-party services being added to Bluemix. These include .NET Runtime in IBM Bluemix and open sourcing of .NET Buildpack which gives s developers in any Cloud Foundry- based environment the ability to leverage Microsoft's development capabilities, making it easier to integrate multiple cloud workloads.

Other moves include the addition of the Namara.io platform by ThinkData Works, which aggregates and catalogues available open data into a single portal, providing businesses, developers, and citizens with API access to high- value information.

The Cupenya Insights service provides an analytics foundation that allows developers to connect and monitor business activities across several Bluemix applications; define key performance indicators, and receive performance overviews of an entire business process or supply chain.

The flowthings.io service by Flow Corporation collects real-time data and provides complex event processing and data delivery that make it easier to integrate applications with almost any software or device in the Internet of Things space.

Reappt from Push Technology delivers over the Internet to give apps a performance edge, the company said.

IBMâ€™s Bluemix was created on open technologies that enable developers to build, run and manage cloud applications and services with more flexibility. It enables developers to mix and match different services and tools that best fit their strategy. IBM launched Bluemix with a $1 billion investment in 2014. Since then, it has become the largest Cloud Foundry deployment in the world, IBM said.

UIBM said it also is supporting the expansion of independent Cloud Foundry Dojo's by establishing the first IBM Cloud Foundry Dojo, located in Raleigh, NC. The IBM Cloud Foundry Dojo will be a physical place open to all developers where IBM will help accelerate skills on the Cloud Foundry Code base and mentor developers.
